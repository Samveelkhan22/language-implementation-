Custom programming language named "Afeeler" Parsing with Python
This repository provides code snippets for parsing loop variables, variable declarations, and initializations in the custom programming language named "Afeeler" using Python. These snippets serve as a handy reference for implementing parsing logic in the "Afeeler" language using Python.

Code Snippets
The repository includes the following code snippets:

Loop Variable Parsing: Code snippet to extract loop variable, start, and step values from a "for" loop initialization in the "Afeeler" language.

Variable Declaration Parsing: Code snippet to parse variable declarations in the "Afeeler" language, extracting data type, variable name, and initial value.

Variable Initialization Parsing: Code snippet to parse variable initializations in the "Afeeler" language, extracting data type, variable name, and initial value.

Usage
To use these code snippets, follow these steps:

Copy the desired code snippet into your Python project.

Adapt the code snippet to fit your specific parsing requirements.

Execute the code snippet in your Python environment.

Observe the extracted loop variables, variable declarations, or initializations from the "Afeeler" language.

Examples
The repository also provides example code that demonstrates the usage of each code snippet. You can run these examples to see the parsing in action.
